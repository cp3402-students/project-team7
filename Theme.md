# Theme Notes

## Introduction
All members worked collaboratively to create a new theme for the U3A Online website in WordPress. See [Development Documentation](https://github.com/cp3402-students/project-team7/blob/main/Development.md#how-to-develop-theme-updates-locally) to learn how to update changes to themes locally.

The majority of theme work was completed during online meetings and discussed through prototyping. See theme idea generation and documentation on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ftk9FYPZKIRmzYvaOuSXYi/Untitled?type=design&node-id=3-261&mode=design&t=rs8fDlsH5ikjVJ1Q-0).

When modifying or developing new themes, make sure that you are considering the key design elements listed below and maintaining flexibility and customisation options for the end user. The latest commit should be the first point of reference for site design choices. The key design elements should be repeated in future theme developments.

## Theme Design Elements:
#### User Interface
The user interface prioritises legibility by employing the font, Segoe UI with sizes ranging from 20 to 28px, specifically catering to elderly individuals who may struggle with small or poorly formatted text. Throughout the website, including the navigation bar, this emphasis on sisable text enhances readability and facilitates easy navigation of key information.

#### Information Architecture
The information architecture is structured to facilitate efficient information retrieval. This involves the implementation of navigation bars and menu icons, enabling users to swiftly locate desired information with minimal effort.

#### Typography
The typography choices are made with consideration to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the content. Ample margins are allotted for headers and body text, preventing content from appearing crowded against the page borders. This utilisation of whitespace contributes to a more organised and aesthetically pleasing layout. Additionally, the incorporation of hover effects on buttons further enhances readability and user engagement, providing clear visual cues as users interact with navigation elements.

#### Colour Scheme
While the colour scheme remains unchanged to preserve the organisational identity and meet client specifications, careful attention is paid to optimising contrast for improved readability and navigation. This includes utilising contrasting colours to enhance legibility and employing highlighted menu options to facilitate intuitive navigation for users.

#### Visual Elements
Consistency with the visual elements of the previous client website is maintained, focusing on promoting educational courses tailored for elderly individuals. However, adjustments in image positioning and sizing are made to ensure seamless integration with content while effectively conveying the intended message to the target audience.

#### Navigation Design
The navigation design is centered around enhancing user experience through clear navigation menus, intuitive search functionality, and well-defined linking structures. By prioritising user-friendly navigation, the website ensures that users can effortlessly access desired content, thereby enhanching their overall browsing experience.

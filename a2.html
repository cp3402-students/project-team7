  <h2>Measureable Goal</h2>
  Our purpose in updating U3A Online was to make it more readable, intuitive and engaging as per the request of our client Glen and the needs of our target audience. It was decided that the best way to confirm the updated site was successful would be from an increased popularity and click conversion: 
  <ul>
  <li>The main goal of updating the site was to attract and keep users - more clicks potentially mean higher conversion rates. The updated site will be succesful if more users create accounts and enrol in study courses. 
  Our group decided that a suitable measureable goal would is a 20% increase in conversion rate (New users create accounts, access a course) and a 10% reduction of bounce rate (Users visit the site but do not create accounts or access a course) within the first 3 months.</li>

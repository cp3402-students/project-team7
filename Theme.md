# Theme Notes

## Introduction
All members worked collaboratively to create a new theme for the U3A Online website in WordPress. See [Development Documentation](https://github.com/cp3402-students/project-team7/blob/main/Development.md) to learn 
how to update changes to themes locally.

The majority of theme work was completed during online meetings and discussed through prototyping. See theme idea generation and documentation on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ftk9FYPZKIRmzYvaOuSXYi/Untitled?type=design&node-id=3-261&mode=design&t=rs8fDlsH5ikjVJ1Q-0).

When modifying or developing new themes, make sure that you are considering the key design elements listed below and maintaining flexibility and customisation options for the end user. The latest commit should be the first point of reference for site design choices. The key design elements should be repeated in future theme developments.


## Theme Design Elements:
#### User Interface
The user interface uses large font that further targets accessibility of elderly individuals who struggle to read small and poorly formatted text. The use of large font througout the website is also implemented in the navigation bar for the target audience to navigate and find the information they need without hesitation. The interface is also simple for useability.

#### Information Architecture
The architecture of the information consists of organising and structuring the website throygh the use of navigation bars and menu icons to promote to help users find information quickly and effectively. 

#### Typography
The typography of the website aimed to include margins for the header and body so the content does not get displayed on the borders of the page. This will allow for the page look more appealing and organised as the use of whitespace will allow for appropriate structure of the content. Additionally, the use of hover buttons further extends the readability alongside the visual appeal by highling to the target audience what section they are hovering over in the navigation bar.

#### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme of the website was not changed to retain the originality of the organisation and further fulful client requirements. This allowed for the team to focus more on the development stages instead of prioritsing too much time on new and appropriate colour schemes. Furthermore, the use of contrast between the colours to make it easy to read and navigate the page that enabled for easier navigation. This can be shown through the highlight menu options to help make the site more intuitive for the user base.

#### Visual Elements
The visual elements used are the same as the previous client website as it promotes the educational courses for elderly people. The only change regarding this will be the image position and size as it still needs to complement the content and convery a message effectively to send a message to the target audience.

#### Navigation Design
The navigation design uses clear navigation menus, search functionality, and linking structures to improve user experience.

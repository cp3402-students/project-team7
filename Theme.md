# Theme Notes

## Introduction
All members are working together to create a new theme for the U3A Online website in WordPress. Github branches are being used for individual theme work, where some files can be pulled from here if decided to be used. However the majority of theme work will be done collaboritvely during our meetings. The key design principles will be consistent throughout our website. 

The key design elements chosen are:
- User interface
- Information architecture
- Typography
- Colour scheme
- Visual elements
- Navigation design

The user interface consist of a large font that further targets accessibility of elderly individuals who struggle to read small and poorly formatted text. The use of large font througout the website is also implemented in the navigation bar for the target audience to navigate and find the information they need without hesitation. 


The architecture of the information consists of organising and structuring the website throygh the use of navigation bars and menu icons to promote to help users find information quickly and effectively. 

The typography of the website aimed to include margins for the header and body so the content does not get displayed on the borders of the page. This will allow for the page look more appealing and organised as the use of whitespace will allow for appropriate structure of the content. Additionally, the use of hover buttons further extends the readability alongside the visual appeal by highling to the target audience what section they are hovering over in the navigation bar.

The colour scheme of the website was not changed to retain the originality of the organisation and further fulful client requirements. This allowed for the team to focus more on the development stages instead of prioritsing too much time on new and appropriate colour schemes. Furthermore, the use of contrast between the colours to make it easy to read and navigate the page that enabled for easier navigation. This can be shown through the highlight menu options to help make the site more intuitive for the user base.
